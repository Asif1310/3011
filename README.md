NAAS offers low-code drivers one could easily use to connect Jupyter Notebooks to applications like LinkedIn, google sheets, HubSpot, Gmail, etc.

I utilized this capability of NAAS to extract data from LinkedIn regarding my 50 recent followers and export it to a google sheet.

I used this google sheet as a data source for a new Tableau Public workbook and created a dashboard with the below details:

1) Geographical distribution of the followers (there's a map on the dashboard depicting it).
2) Industries of these followers.
3) Their standing in my network (first degree, second degree, third degree, or out-of-network).

Rather than performing an exhaustive analysis of the data via this project, I mainly intended to show that it becomes an easy task to integrate applications with Jupyter notebooks using NAAS drivers and templates.

I created below dashboard in Tableau:

This is the link to view the dashboard:

The most amazing thing about this project is that I can re-create this dashboard for a new set of followers after some time period by re-running the notebook in naas environment and refreshing the data source on Tableau.
